# FP Experiences â€” Tracking Audit

## Channels & toggles
- **GA4 / GTM**: Enabled when an ID is saved and consent granted (`Consent::granted(ga4)`). Events pushed via front.js (`view_item`, `select_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`) and purchase payload emitted on thank-you page by `Integrations\GA4`.
- **Google Ads**: Uses conversion ID/label stored in settings; payload piggybacks on the dataLayer purchase event. Enhanced conversions honour consent before hashing customer data.
- **Meta Pixel**: Injected only when pixel ID set and consent granted; purchase payload derived from WooCommerce order meta with optional server-side ID passthrough.
- **Microsoft Clarity**: Script tag rendered only when toggle enabled and consent channel `clarity` granted.
- Front-end and PHP integrations double-check the channel `enabled` flag before outputting scripts, preventing dormant IDs from firing without consent.

## Request-to-Book events
Front-end script emits dedicated events for RTB lifecycle:
- `fpExp.request_submit` when the request form posts.
- `fpExp.request_success` after approval/confirmation payload returns.
- `fpExp.request_error` on validation or transport errors.

## Gift & add-on tracking
- `add_on_view` fires once per add-on when it enters the booking widget viewport. Payload includes the experience context and add-on slug/label/price for GA4.
- `gift_purchase` pushes voucher purchases with ecommerce metadata (value, currency, quantity, add-ons) before redirecting to WooCommerce checkout.
- `gift_redeem` emits when a voucher is redeemed, attaching slot ID, reservation/order IDs, prepaid add-ons, and the voucher value for zero-cost conversions.

## UTM propagation
- `Helpers::read_utm_cookie()` sanitises the `fp_exp_utm` cookie and saves the payload on reservations/orders.
- Brevo contact upsert forwards `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, and tag `experience:{slug}` for segmentation.

## Consent bridge
- `Utils\Consent::granted()` exposes `fp_exp_tracking_consent` filter so CMPs (Complianz, CookieYes, etc.) can override per-channel decisions before scripts enqueue.

Status: Updated for v0.3.0 release (gift workflow, add-on visibility events, consent-aware ecommerce payloads).
