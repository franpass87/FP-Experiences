# Phase 2 â€“ Add-on images

## QA checklist

- [x] Added an image to an add-on from the experience editor and confirmed the preview updates without reloading the page.
- [x] Removed the add-on image and verified the placeholder state returns with the remove button hidden.
- [x] Created a new add-on row via the repeater and checked that the media picker bindings work on the duplicated template.
- [x] Viewed the booking widget on the front-end and saw the selected thumbnail rendered with lazy loading, alt text, and no layout shift.
- [x] Confirmed add-ons without images fall back to the inline placeholder icon on the front-end widget.
